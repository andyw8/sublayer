      string: '{"contents":{"role":"user","parts":{"text":"    You are an expert ruby
        programmer and and great at repurposing code examples to use for new situations.\n\n    A
        Sublayer generator is a class that acts as an abstraction for sending a request
        to an LLM and getting structured data back.\n\n    An example Sublayer generator
        is:\n    <example_generator>\n    class CodeFromDescriptionGenerator < Sublayer::Generators::Base\n  llm_output_adapter
        type: :single_string,\n    name: \"generated_code\",\n    description: \"The
        generated code in the requested language\"\n\n  def initialize(description:,
        technologies:)\n    @description = description\n    @technologies = technologies\n  end\n\n  def
        generate\n    super\n  end\n\n  def prompt\n    <<-PROMPT\n        You are
        an expert programmer in #{@technologies.join(\", \")}.\n\n        You are
        tasked with writing code using the following technologies: #{@technologies.join(\",
        \")}.\n\n        The description of the task is #{@description}\n\n        Take
        a deep breath and think step by step before you start coding.\n    PROMPT\n  end\nend\n\n    </example_generator>\n\n    And
        it is the generator we''re currently using for taking in a description from
        a user and generating a new Sublayer generator.\n\n    All Sublayer::Generators
        inherit from Sublayer::Generators::Base and have a generate method that simply
        calls super for the user to use and modify for their uses.\n\n    the llm_output_adapter
        directive is used to instruct the LLM on what structure of output to generate.
        In the example we''re using type: :single_string which takes a name and description
        as arguments.\n\n    the other available options and their example usage is:\n    llm_output_adapter
        type: :list_of_strings,\n      name: \"suggestions\",\n      description:
        \"List of keyword suggestions\"\n\n    llm_output_adapter type: :single_integer,\n      name:
        \"four_digit_passcode\",\n      description: \"an uncommon and difficult to
        guess four digit passcode\"\n\n    llm_output_adapter type: :list_of_named_strings,\n      name:
        \"review_summaries\",\n      description: \"List of movie reviews\",\n      item_name:
        \"review\",\n      attributes: [\n        { name: \"movie_title\", description:
        \"The title of the movie\" },\n        { name: \"reviewer_name\", description:
        \"The name of the reviewer\" },\n        { name: \"rating\", description:
        \"The rating given by the reviewer (out of 5 stars)\" },\n        { name:
        \"brief_comment\", description: \"A brief summary of the movie\" }\n      ]\n\n    llm_output_adapter
        type: :named_strings,\n      name: \"product_description\",\n      description:
        \"Generate product descriptions\",\n      attributes: [\n        { name: \"short_description\",
        description: \"A brief one-sentence description of the product\" },\n        {
        name: \"long_description\", description: \"A detailed paragraph describing
        the product\" },\n        { name: \"key_features\", description: \"A comma-separated
        list of key product features\" },\n        { name: \"target_audience\", description:
        \"A brief description of the target audience for this product\" }\n      ]\n\n    #
        Where :available_routes is a method that returns an array of available routes\n    llm_output_adapter
        type: :string_selection_from_list,\n      name: \"route\",\n      description:
        \"A route selected from the list\",\n      options: :available_routes\n\n    #
        Where @sentiment_options is an array of sentiment values passed in to the
        initializer\n    llm_output_adapter type: :string_selection_from_list,\n      name:
        \"sentiment_value\",\n      description: \"A sentiment value from the list\",\n      options:
        -> { @sentiment_options }\n\n    Besides that, a Sublayer::Generator also
        has a prompt method that describes the task to the LLM and provides any necessary
        context for the generation which\n    is either passed in through the initializer
        or accessed in the prompt itself.\n\n    You have a description provided by
        the user to generate a new sublayer generator.\n\n    You are tasked with
        creating a new sublayer generator according to the given description.\n\n    Consider
        the details and requirements mentioned in the description to create the appropriate
        Sublayer::Generator.\n    <users_description>\n    a sublayer generator that
        takes in code and converts it to the users requested programming language\n    </users_description>\n\n    Take
        a deep breath and reflect on each aspect of the description before proceeding
        with the generation.\n"}},"generationConfig":{"responseMimeType":"application/json","responseSchema":{"type":"OBJECT","properties":{"sublayer_generator":{"type":"object","description":"The
