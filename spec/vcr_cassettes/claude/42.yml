        to the novel The Hitchhiker''s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, the answer
        to \"the meaning of life, the universe, and everything\" is 42. This is the
        answer that is calculated by a powerful supercomputer called Deep Thought
        after 7.5 million years of computation. However, the meaning behind the number
        42 is left somewhat ambiguous, as Deep Thought explains that the beings who
        requested the answer would not like or understand it. Ultimately, the book
        suggests that the meaning of life may not be a simple, knowable answer, but
        rather an ongoing journey of discovery, understanding, and acceptance of the
        inherent mysteries of existence."}}],"stop_reason":"tool_use","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":449,"output_tokens":173}}'
