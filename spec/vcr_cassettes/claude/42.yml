        to the classic science fiction novel \"The Hitchhiker''s Guide to the Galaxy\"
        by Douglas Adams, the answer to \"the ultimate question of life, the universe,
        and everything\" is 42. The book explains that this answer was computed by
        a giant supercomputer after 7.5 million years of calculations, but the problem
        was that the beings who commissioned the computer had forgotten to include
        the actual question. So now we know the answer, but not the question!\n\nIn
        a more serious sense, the meaning of life, the universe, and everything is
        a deep philosophical and existential question that has puzzled humanity for
        millennia. There is no single agreed-upon answer, but many religions, philosophies,
        and belief systems offer their own perspectives on the purpose of existence
        and the nature of the cosmos. Ultimately, the meaning of it all may be something
        each individual has to discover and define for themselves.\n</scratch>\n</response>"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn"}'
